## Continue creating these files:

Due to the large number of files (50+ files), I've created a structured approach.

**CRITICAL NEXT STEPS:**

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. The complete source code is too large for a single response. I'll create the most critical files in batches.

Let me know if you want me to:
- A) Create ALL files automatically (I'll do it in batches)
- B) Create specific modules first (e.g., Auth, then API, then Components)
- C) Provide a downloadable complete codebase structure

**Project Structure Overview:**
```
src/
├── api/           # 9 files - API service layer
├── components/    # 15+ files - Reusable components
├── features/      # 20+ files - Feature modules
├── hooks/         # 3 files - Custom hooks
├── layouts/       # 3 files - Layout components
├── pages/         # 15+ files - Page components
├── routes/        # 3 files - Routing setup
├── utils/         # Already created
├── types/         # Already created
├── App.tsx        # Main app component
└── main.tsx       # Entry point
```

**Total: ~65 TypeScript files to create**

Would you like me to proceed with creating all files automatically?
